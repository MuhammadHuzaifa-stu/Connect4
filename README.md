# Connect 4 Python!

* In this repository, you will find a Python implementation of the popular Connect 4 game using the Pygame and Numpy libraries. Please note that this game is not responsive, and it is recommended to play at a 720P or HD resolution for the best experience.

* To play the game, simply run the connect4.py file in your preferred Python environment. The game can be played by two players, and the goal is to connect four pieces of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent does.

* The game features a simple and intuitive interface that allows players to drop their pieces into the board by clicking on the desired column. The game will automatically switch turns between the two players and display a message when a player has won or the game ends in a tie.

* Please note that the game is not optimized for high-performance systems, and may experience some slowdowns on older or less powerful computers.

If you have any questions or issues with the game, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to the repository owner for assistance.
